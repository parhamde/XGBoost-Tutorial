# XGBoost-Tutorial

**XGBoost** is an acronym for **Extreme Gradient Boosting**. It is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve classification and regression problems. In this project, I implement XGBoost with Python and Scikit-Learn to solve a classification problem. The problem is to classify the customers from two different channels as Horeca (Hotel/Retail/Caf√©) customers or Retail channel (nominal) customers.
